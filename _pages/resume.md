<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am a skilled Developer Relations practitioner with over 25 years of technical training, software architecture, team and product management and software development experience.</p>
<p>My most recent employment was as the Principal Developer Advocate for <a href="https://redis.com" target="_blank">Redis</a>, where I enjoyed technical storytelling through coding, writing and presenting: both on video and in person.  My role also meant I was amongst the first developers to use Redis products - using my application development expertise to help shape and fine-tune the developer experience.</p>
<p>I regularly create software and hardware projects, and write and publish videos about them on my personal website at <a href="https://simonprickett.dev" target="_blank">https://simonprickett.dev</a>.  I am particularly interested in APIs and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>You'll also find my coding projects on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/simonprickett" target="_blank">https://github.com/simonprickett</a>.  My work has been featured in the Arduino, Adafruit and Cloudflare blogs as well as The MagPi - Raspberry Pi's official magazine.</p>

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
<ul>
    <li>My primary skill is deep technical storytelling and communication. I introduce developers to concepts and ideas in ways that appeal to them through engaging example applications that are well documented and explained in workshops, videos, blogs and conference talks.</li>
    <li>I am a polyglot, mostly backend, developer that can usually be found developing with Node.js, although I frequently also produce code and content targeted at Python and Java Developers.  I have experience working in C/C++ and familiarity with a number of other programming languages and frameworks including Flask and Express.</li>
    <li>I've worked with a range of databases, most recently/notably Redis but also Firebase, Postgres, MySQL and Oracle.</li>
    <li>I am familiar with AWS and Google Cloud... particularly the serverless functions and AppEngine products.</li>
    <li>I am not a front end developer, however, I am comfortable working with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and frameworks such as Bulma.</li>
    <li>I like to use a Kanban approach to managing my work, and enjoy working with tools from GitHub, Atlassian and Pivotal Labs to plan and communicate work.</li>
    <li>I have extensive experience with designing and implementing complex systems and contributing to open source projects.</li>
</ul>
