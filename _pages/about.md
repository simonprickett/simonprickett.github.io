            <p class="lead">Hi - thanks for dropping by.  I'm Simon Prickett, an experienced software 
               professional based in sunny San Diego, California USA.</p>
            <p>I'm currently working as a Curriculum Engineer for <a href="https://redislabs.com">Redis Labs</a> where I develop course materials and accompanying example applications for our online <a href="https://redislabs.com/university/">Redis University courses</a>.  I'm the principal teacher for the <a href="https://redislabs.com/courses/redis-javascript-developers/">Redis for JavaScript (Node.js) Developers</a> course, and have also contributed to the Redis Streams and Redis for Java Developers courses.</p>
            <p>I've been coding since I received a Sinclair ZX Spectrum as a Christmas 
               present in the early 1980s.  I have particularly fond memories of owning 
               and developing software for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga.</p>
            <p>My interest in coding led to an 'A' level in Computing Science, then a 
               four year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://aston.ac.uk">Aston University</a>, 
               Birmingham England.  Whilst at Aston, I discovered UNIX like operating 
               systems and have been hooked on these ever since.  For my final year 
               project I built a graphical interface for a jet engine simulation 
               using C and MATLAB on Solaris.</p>
            <p>As part of the degree program, I spent a year working at Hewlett-Packard 
               where I adminstered a mixed fleet of HP-UX, Solaris, AIX and SCO UNIX 
               machines and learned a lot about software development in a team.  HP hired 
               me straight from university, and relocated me to <a href="https://hpl.hp.com">HP Labs</a> in Palo Alto, 
               California to work on a large C++ project.  This was a real in at the 
               deep end role requiring me to write portable code that could run on 
               HP-UX, Solaris, AIX and Windows NT.</p>
            <p>I've subsequently enjoyed a career that's involved living and working 
               in England, New Zealand and on both coasts of the USA.  I've also 
               traveled extensively delivering technical training on consuting engagements 
               and once expense claimed a round the world ticket :)</p>
            <p>Outside of my day job, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi and Arduino 
               single board computers and building hardware projects with them.  I 
               recently acquired a BBC micro:bit and need to spend some time learning 
               about that.  I periodically write about IoT topics and speak at 
               Meetup groups or conferences.</p>
            <p>Away from computing, I enjoy travel, reading, cycling and watching 
               NHL hockey.  I continue to follow my home town soccer team Nottingham 
               Forest, and recently started 5k running.</p>
