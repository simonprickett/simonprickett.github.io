I was minding my own business in the local Lidl, shopping for some breakfast items.  As I turned a corner into the infamous "Middle of Lidl" aisle, I spotted a Lego Shuttle set that I wasn't aware existed... of course I had to get it (it was the only one left too) so here's a short article about my experience building it.

I already have the much larger Shuttle Discovery Lego set to build (probably in February when it's really cold, dark and snowy) but I thought this "Creator" series one would go nicely with my Creator Land Rover Defender that I acquired a few months ago.

Lego have actually made a few Creator Shuttle kits... this particular one is the 31134 version.  It includes instructions for a couple of other builds, but of course you're only going to want to make a Shuttle from it!  The styling of this one reminds me of the Soviet Buran programme orbiter.

Here's my Lidl receipt... this set is priced nicely at under Â£10 in most places.  As you can see, one of these items doesn't meet the brief of "go to the shop and buy breakfast"...

And here's a picture of everything I bought once I'd got it all home.

As with previous Lego builds I've documented on this site, I made a video showing how it came together.  Here's the finished product with the build process sped up to 3 minutes:

And here's some still pictures of this set:

I tried a different recording technique for this video.  Previously I'd used the front facing camera on my iPhone 7 and a small desktop tripod.  This time I recorded with the Logitech webcam that sits on top of my iMac.  As with previous Lego build videos, I edited the video in iMovie using it to remove the original background noise, add titles and speed things up.  The music is called ["Coffee on the Patio"](https://uppbeat.io/track/avbe/coffee-on-the-patio) and is by AVBE.  I got it from uppbeat.

If you'd like to get your own Creator Shuttle, [pick up a kit over at the Lego website](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/space-shuttle-31134)!  If you're interested in learning more about real Space Shuttles, check out the [Smithsonian's page for Discovery](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/space-shuttle-discovery/nasm_A20120325000).  I've been lucky to visit all of the remaining Shuttles in retirement, as well as Enterprise (the Shuttle programme atmospheric flight test vehicle - [details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Enterprise)).  Here's a pic I took at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum at Dulles Airport in Virginia when they received Discovery and sent Enterprise up to New York City for display there.

You can also visit the Buran aerodynamic analogue (known as [OK-GLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK-GLI)) at the technical museum in Speyer Germany.  I was lucky enough to be able to go there whilst on a business trip, here's a photo I took...
