## Resources

Here's some things you'll need to buy / download to build your own version of this project:

* [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-w?variant=40454061752403) - get the version with headers pre-soldered if you can, otherwise you'll need to buy [appropriate headers](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-header-pack?variant=32374935715923) and solder them on yourself.
* TODO other stuff...

## Keep in Touch!

If you build one of these and use it, I'd love to hear from you - get in touch via my [contact page](/contact) or on whatever [Twitter](https://twitter.com/simon_prickett) calls itself at the time of reading.
