## Shopping List

Here's what you'll need to build your own desktop Pi 4... links are for USA suppliers.  If you're in the UK/EU, [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) will have most of this stuff.

* Raspberry Pi 4 (I used the [4Gb RAM model](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296), but there's also an [8Gb](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4564)).
* Appropriate [USB C power supply for the Pi 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4298).
* [Micro SD card](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDHC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYBBBBH) (whatever size suits your needs, I used 64Gb and I like SanDisk products).
* [Argon One Raspberry Pi 4 case](https://www.argon40.com/catalog/product/view/id/52/s/argon-one-raspberry-pi-4-case/category/4/) with fan and power switch.  I bought mine while visiting the UK, and got it from [amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B086JXR75B/)

You'll also want a couple of things you might already have:

* USB mouse.
* USB keyboard.

I used some older Microsoft products I had on hand.
