This is placeholder text and will eventually be replaced by the real thing.  This article may also include random images from other projects until I swap them out for content relevant to this project.

This was the fifth project in my [Things on Thursdays IoT live streaming series](/things-on-thursdays-livestreams/).  

TODO this should be a description of the project...
