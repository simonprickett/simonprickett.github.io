In this talk that I produced for Pycon USA 2021 I take a look at the Hyperloglog and Bloom Filter probabilistic data structures, using examples with the Python language and [Redis](https://redis.io/) with the [RedisBloom module](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisbloom/).

You can watch the video here, the article that follows is a transcript of the talk:
