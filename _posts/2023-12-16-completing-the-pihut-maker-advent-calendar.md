## Current Live Streaming Setup

I got asked on Twitter how I was making these live streams... here's the ever evolving setup I use with links to each product / item.  

I use [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) as the broadcast "studio" software.  It runs entirely in the browser and handles the screen layout, support for the multiple cameras I am using and the titles you see on screen during the stream as well as the countdown before it.  It allows easy desktop sharing and allows me to bring remote guests onto the stream simply by sharing a URL with them.  I've used StreamYard a lot in the past, and highly recommend it. I use the "Professional" subscription to get 1080p streaming and multiple camera views.  If you have a laptop with microphone and camera, StreamYard is all you need to get going with live streaming.  Everything else on this list could be considered optional / nice to have.

StreamYard is configured to broadcast to my Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Twitch accounts.  Configuring these is extremely straightforward.  I choose to stream to all four of my configured destinations but could mix and match as needed.  Streamyard brings audience comments made during the stream to a central location where I can pop them up on screen to share with the audience.  It also gives me a central place from which to reply to the audience in real time.

TODO kofi bot.

The main camera (the one you see me through) is a [Logitech Brio 4K Stream](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/webcams/brio-stream-4k-hd-webcam.960-001194.html).  It's attached to my iMac (27" 2019 Intel 5k model, not particularly high spec but I do have 128Gb RAM) by a USB cable.  The secondary camera (usually showing things on the desk) is an older [Logitech C922](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001088.html), also attached to the iMac by a USB cable.  The secondary camera is currently on a small tripod - I'd like to move this to an overhead boom / arm setup sometime.

I use a [Blue Yeti Nano](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/streaming-gear/yeti-nano-usb-microphone.988-000205.html) microphone.  It's on a boom arm and attaches to the iMac via yet another USB cable (so I use a USB hub as there's so many things - my mouse and keyboard are also USB and I usually need a USB to Micro USB cable to power the Pico / other IoT thing I am working with on stream).  The microphone has got a foam pop filter over it, and I run it in cardioid mode to try and control the direction that it picks up sounds from.  I feel the microphone is the weak part of the current setup - either the product or the placement of it.  In early videos for this series you'll notice my sound trailing off when I'm looking over at the second camera to the side of me.  I've changed the microphone placement and input gain settings to try and help with this and will continue to work on it.

I also have a [Stream Deck Mini](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/stream-deck-mini) which is an 8 key programmable macro pad.  I haven't used it on these streams so far, but intend to once I've reprogrammed it to handle some of the layout transitions in StreamYard - for example when I go from full screen me to sharing a desktop and the second camera.  I've had a lot of success using this before to switch between applications when sharing desktop (for example the terminal, VSCode, browser, full-screen Keynote slides) and highly recommend it.  They make larger versions with basically more buttons, but I'm happy with this cheapest one.  It connects to the iMac by yet another USB cable.
