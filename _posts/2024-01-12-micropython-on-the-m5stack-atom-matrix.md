Last year I noticed that UK Raspberry Pi reseller The Pi Hut had made a really nice looking "12 Projects of Codemas" maker advent calendar.  It was a large box containing 12 smaller ones, each containing parts that built up various Raspberry Pi Pico projects.  I missed out on this last year, so got organized this time around and bought one relatively early in the seasonal shopping window.

Rather than just play around with this myself for my own entertainment, I decided to make live stream videos of me doing each day's project... and to do them all with no prior knowledge: The first time I look at the instructions or know what's in each day's box is when I open it on the stream.

If you'd like to buy your own box, The Pi Hut do two versions... the "Maker" one that I have plus a second one that focusses more on LEDs.  I won't link to the products directly as I'm not sure if they're in the store year round, but they should be easy to find from the store home page [here](https://thepihut.com/).  They cost Â£40.00 and contain everything you need other than a computer to edit and run the code from.

Here's an image...

TODO Here's the videos I made... beginning of course with a bit of an introduction and day one's box: setting up the Pi Pico H, installing MicroPython and running some tests.

Day two's box contained some LEDs, so I wired those up and learned how to use GPIO pins as outputs from MicroPython.

Day three introduced the use of GPIO pins for inputs by adding three buttons and associated wiring.

TODO wrap up and other information...

TODO changes to this CTA. Hope you enjoyed this - if you'd like to see more of this sort of thing or want to share your projects with me I'd love to hear from you  ([Contact me here](/contact)).
