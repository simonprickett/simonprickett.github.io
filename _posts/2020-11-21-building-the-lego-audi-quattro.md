I received Lego's kit of the 1985 Audi Sport Quattro S1 for my birthday recently, and decided to have a bit of fun building it by recording the process using my iPhone, then making a sped up video of it.  

Building the kit was a nice way to spend an hour or so, and Lego provide great instructions as always.  There's a few decals that need to be applied semi-carefully, but nothing too hard - it's rated as an age 7 and up kit and that seems appropriate.

The kit has two separate parts bags, so I filmed the build in two takes - one for bag one, the other for bag two.  Here's the finished video:

And here's some still pictures of the finished product:

I was pretty impressed with the video results using the front facing camera on my iPhone 7 which was clamped into a tripod.  I used iMovie to edit it together, add some titles and speed it up.  The music was free and it's called "Box" by "Bimbotronic".  It's [available from their page on icons8.com](https://icons8.com/music/author/bimbotronic).

If you'd like to get one yourself, [pick up a kit over at the Lego website](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/1985-audi-sport-quattro-s1-76897)!

I've subsequently built a couple of other Lego sets, have a look at my build articles for each:
