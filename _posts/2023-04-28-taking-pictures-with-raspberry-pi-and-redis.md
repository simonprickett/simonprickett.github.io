TODO this needs to be the introductory paragraph that contains some meaningful text and all that stuff.

TODO project overview...

Here's what my initial Raspberry Pi camera setup looked like.  I used a [Raspberry Pi 3B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) (I had one around, any model with the camera interface will work), the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2.1](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) and a [case from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2256).  I held the camera onto the case using electrical tape.

This was the ninth project in my [Things on Thursdays IoT live streaming series](/things-on-thursdays-livestreams/).  I aim to work on this some more and enhance it with search capabilities... when I do I'll be sure to make some more videos and update this article and the codebase.

Here's the video run through of the project that I did as a live stream in April 2023:

# Try it Yourself!

If you have a Pi and a camera module, this project should be fairly simple to set up and get running on your own hardware.  I've made the [source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/simonprickett/redis-pi-camera), feel free to use is for whatever you like!  I've provided instructions for how to set up each component and get a Redis instance in the cloud or using Docker.  I'd love to see what you make, [drop me a line](/contact/) if you come up with something new.
