# Try it Yourself!

If you have a Pi and a camera module, this project should be fairly simple to set up and get running on your own hardware.  I've made the [source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/simonprickett/redis-pi-camera), feel free to use is for whatever you like!  I'd love to see what you make, [drop me a line](/contact/) if you come up with something new.
