TODO this will need to be the initial introduction and all that stuff and we'll probably want to have a GIF or make a video about this project so people can see it, as well as link to the live version.

TODO this is what a video would look like..

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRejaScBBcU?si=UVZegorOGzDUBo35" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><br/>

Here's some more text and an image carousel.

<div class="slick-carousel">
    <div>
        <figure class="figure">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carbonintensity_north_scotland.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Windy and green in North Scotland.">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Windy and green in North Scotland.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div>
        <figure class="figure">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carbonintensity_north_wales.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Nuclear, gas and Wind mix in North Wales - slightly less green.">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Nuclear, gas and Wind mix in North Wales - slightly less green.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div>
        <figure class="figure">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carbonintensity_east_england.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Gas and Nuclear in East England - orange, starting to get concerning!">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Gas and Nuclear in East England - orange, starting to get concerning!</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div>
        <figure class="figure">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carbonintensity_south_wales.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Red alert in South Wales - nearly all gas.">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Red alert in South Wales - nearly all gas.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

</div>

And here's a single still picture:

<figure class="figure">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/carbonintensity_kit.png" alt="The hardware needed to run this example.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The hardware needed to run this example.</figcaption>
</figure>
