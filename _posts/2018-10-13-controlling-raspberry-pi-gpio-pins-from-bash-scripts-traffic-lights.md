I’ve previously produced guides describing how to use the Low Voltage Labs traffic lights with Raspberry Pi single board computers for Python ([read Python article]({{ site.baseurl}}/playing-with-raspberry-pi-traffic-lights)), Swift ([read Swift article]({{ site.baseurl }}/raspberry-pi-coding-in-swift-traffic-lights)), Node.js ([read Node.js article]({{ site.baseurl }}/raspberry-pi-coding-with-node-js-traffic-lights)), Node RED ([read Node RED article]({{ site.baseurl }}/raspberry-pi-coding-with-node-red-traffic-lights/)), Java ([read Java article]({{ site.baseurl}}/playing-with-raspberry-pi-gpio-pins-and-traffic-lights-in-java)), C ([read C article]({{ site.baseurl}}/gpio-access-in-c-with-raspberry-pi-traffic-lights)), Go ([read Go article]({{ site.baseurl}}/raspberry-pi-coding-in-go-traffic-lights)) and [.NET/C#]({{ site.baseurl }}/raspberry-pi-coding-with-dotnet-traffic-lights/). I even did this for Arduino ([read Arduino article]({{ site.baseurl}}/traffic-lights-with-arduino/)).  This time, I’ll look at using a Bash script to do the same thing without employing a traditional programming language.

To make this a standalone guide, there will be some re-use of content from the prior articles here.

## Shopping List

To try this out, you will need the following (links here mostly go to [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), UK customers may want to consider [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/) as a UK based alternative, Amazon has most if not all of this stuff too):

* A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055) (I'll use the Pi 3 Model B here, but any model with GPIO pins will work — if you want to use the Pi Zero you’ll need to solder some headers onto it). I'm going to assume you have a Pi 2 or 3 with 40 pins
* A [power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995) for your Pi (Raspberry Pi 4 requires a different [USB C power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4298))
* Some sort of [case](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2256) is probably a good idea to protect the Pi (but you’ll need to leave the lid off to expose the GPIO pins to connect your lights to)
* A [Micro SD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1294) to install your operating system on (or [get one with the OS pre-installed](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3259)). If you want to install the operating system yourself, you'll need a Mac, PC, Linux machine with an SD card reader
* A set of [traffic lights from Low Voltage Labs](http://lowvoltagelabs.com/products/pi-traffic/) (the two pack is good value)
* Any USB keyboard to type on the Pi, you might want a mouse too
* Any HDMI display to show output from the Pi

## Attaching the Traffic Lights

The Low Voltage Labs traffic lights connect to the Pi using four pins. One of these needs to be ground, the other three being actual GPIO pins used to control each of the individual LEDs.

Before powering up the Pi, attach the traffic lights so that the pins connect to the GPIO pins highlighted in red:

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">GPIO Pin Diagram.</figcaption>
</figure>

When you're done it's going to look something like this... (an easy way to make sure you have it right is to locate the lights on the left hand row of pins as you look at the Pi with the USB ports to the bottom, then count 8 pins up and attach the lights there).

Don't turn the Pi on yet, you'll need to prepare an operating system image for it first...

## Operating System Setup

Install the Raspbian OS which can be [downloaded from the official Raspberry Pi site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). You can also find an excellent [installation guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) there should you need help.

Once you've got the operating system installed, make sure you can login, and have a working wired or wifi internet connection.

Now you can go ahead and start turning lights on and off!

## Installing Dependencies

As Bash comes with the operating system, the only thing left to install is git so we can download the sample code from GitHub:

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git --version

git version 2.11.0
```

## Downloading the Sample Code

I’ve written some sample C code to demonstrate running the traffic lights in the UK light sequence (red, red + amber, green, amber, red):

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Lights installed and working.</figcaption>
</figure>

To get the source code for this example from GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/simonprickett/bash-traffic-lights-pi.git
```

## Accessing the GPIO Pins from a Bash Script

Without adding further dependencies, Bash scripts can access and control the Pi’s GPIO pins using sysfs. This presents as a set of filesystem paths which can be manipulated to configure individual pins as inputs or outputs and to set and read their values. On the Pi, these paths look like:

```
/sys/class/gpio/gpio<pin_number>
```

and each has a `/direction` and `/value`, for example for GPIO 11:

```
/sys/class/gpio/gpio11/direction
/sys/class/gpio/gpio11/value
```

As we will see later in this article, the direction and value can be set by writing values to these "paths" as the `root` user on the Pi.

The pin numbering scheme used by sysfs is the Broadcom (BCM) one, so the pin numbers that you need to use will match those in the diagram earlier in this article.

## Running the Demo

Starting the demo is as simple as executing the script as root:

```
$ cd bash-traffic-lights-pi
$ sudo ./trafficlights.s
```

To stop the demo, press Ctrl-C at any time.

Note the use of `sudo` when starting the script. This allows it to run as the root user with access to write the file paths needed to control the GPIO pins using sysfs.

## How it Works

Here’s the code, contained in `trafficlights.sh` in the GitHub repo:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/simonprickett/027cfbfb98a0dd1bb5e1a6ce24d19676.js"></script>

Lines 1–13 set up some variables so that things we need have more meaningful names. The red LED is on GPIO 9, yellow on 10 and green on 11. We also abstract out the common base path `/sys/class/gpio` as we will be using that a lot. `ON` and `OFF` are used as they are more meaningful than the actual `1` and `0` values that the script will use.

### Exporting Pins

In order to use a GPIO pin through sysfs, we first have to "export" each one to make the appropriate paths available. The function `exportPin` at lines 16–21 does this. For example to export pin 9 it will use the following command (once all variables have been resolved to their values):

```
echo "9" > /sys/class/gpio/export
```

This creates paths in `/sys/class/gpio` for pin 9 but will error if those paths exist already. To overcome this the `exportPin` function checks first and will only export a pin if the path to it does not yet exist.

### Setting Pin Direction

Pins can be used for input or output. In this case we need to use them as outputs to control each of the three LEDs on the traffic lights. The function setOutput (lines 24–27) does this by sending "out" to the "direction" path for the pin. Example for GPIO 9:

```
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio9/direction
```

### Turning Lights On and Off

Function `setLightState` at lines 30–33 handles turning one of the lights on and off by setting its GPIO pin to high (`1` — on) or low (`0` — off). It does this by writing either `1` or `0` to the `value` path for the pin. 

Example for GPIO 9:

```
echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio9/value
```

### Turning Everything Off on Exit

The code’s going to run in an infinite loop exiting when Ctrl-C is pressed and the `SIGINT` signal is sent. In order to tidy up and turn all three of the lights off when this happens we need to trap and handle the `SIGINT` signal. This is achieved with lines 44–50 which define a function shutdown and register it as the handler for `SIGINT`.

`shutdown` calls another utility function that in turn calls `setLightState` for each of the three lights to switch them off. It then uses exit to cleanly stop the script, returning control to the shell.

### The Main Code Loop

The main code entry point starts at line 52 and uses the functions we defined earlier to export each of the three required pins and to set them as outputs. It then calls the utility function `allLightsOff` which ensures that all three of the traffic light LEDs are turned off so that we are in a known state to begin from.

Lines 66–89 are an infinite loop in which we use `setLightState` to turn individual traffic light LEDs on and off in the correct order for a UK traffic light (red, red + yellow, green, yellow, red, repeat...). The built in `sleep` command allows the code to stay in each state for a few seconds before moving to the next.

The source code for this project is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/simonprickett/bash-traffic-lights-pi).
