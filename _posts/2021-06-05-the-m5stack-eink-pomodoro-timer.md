The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Italian Francesco Cirillo in which a timer is used to break work into time periods separated by breaks.  Each time period is called a pomodoro - Cirillo used a tomato shaped kitchen timer, and "tomato" in Italian is "pomodoro".

[M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/) is a company that makes a fascinating range of modular IoT devices and I'd wanted to try one for a while.  I decided to start with their [Core Ink](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/coreink) product.  I bought mine from [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit-1-54-elnk-display), M5Stack [also sell them direct](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/m5-core/products/m5stack-esp32-core-ink-development-kit1-54-elnk-display).

This is a really nice self-contained unit with some buttons, an e-ink screen, a buzzer, rechargable battery and wifi capabilities.  It all fits inside a really nice case and looks like this:

  </figure>
</div>

I decided to use the Core Ink to make a Pomodoro timer as a gift to a loved one,  programming in C using the Arduino IDE.  I got my code onto it using the supplied USB C cable.  Here's what the final product looks like (sped up in the video):

Hope you enjoyed reading about this - if you get a Core Ink and want to try this out, I've put the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/simonprickett/m5stack-pomodoro) and you're free to use it or modify it for your own purposes.  I'd love to see what you build!
